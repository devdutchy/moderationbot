## Setup
To get started, follow the following steps:

1. Fork and clone the **master branch** of the repository.
2. To install all dependencies, run `npm install`.
3. Start coding your heart out!

When you have finished, run `npm run test`, which will run eslint. Make sure this passes before submitting a PR. Ensure that any JSDoc changes are valid, and if that's done, [submit a PR!](https://github.com/devdutchy/moderationbot/compare)
